# kickstarter_blockchain_solution
After receving money in a kickstarter campaign companies often run away with the money. This smart contract uses blockchain to prevent that from happening. It gives contributers power to decide whether or not they want a particular vender or manufacturer to receve money.

The manager of the campaign will generate a request for money to be send to various vendor and manufactures for various parts or services that are required to make the product.This request needs to be approved by the people who have contributed to the project.
If the number of approvers are more than half of the number of contributer, the money will be send to the vendor (or manufacturer).
